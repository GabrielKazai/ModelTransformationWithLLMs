Based on the provided XMI code, the corresponding Java code would look like this:

```java
public class City {
    private List<Houses> houses;
}

public class Houses {
    private Family family;
}

public class Family {
    private Father father;
    private Mother mother;
    private List<Child> children;
}

public class Father {
}

public class Mother {
}

public class Child {
}
```

Please note that the code above is a direct translation of the class diagram represented in the XMI code, and it does not include any additional methods or constructors.
