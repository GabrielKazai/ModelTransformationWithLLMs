Could not generate InputChannel and OutputChannel in the oracle, ignore these classes

Integer = Int

Boolean = boolean

TextInputChannel --> readUnlimitedNatural:
oracle: return null;	GPT: return 0;
return was auto generated by modelio, was not in the XMI, can be ignored?

The keyword final is never mentioned in the XMI, instead added by modelio, can be ignored

TextOutputChannel --> writeUnlimitedNatural:
return type in oracle: unlimitedNatural, return type in GPT: int
from xmi: name="value" type="UnlimitedNatural">, GPT is wrong ------

public class unlimitedNatural --> GPT did not generate this class -----

Listener:
Oracle didn't have ability to generate Notifaction, syntax is wrong. GPT generated Notification +++++

Second iteration? Yes.
