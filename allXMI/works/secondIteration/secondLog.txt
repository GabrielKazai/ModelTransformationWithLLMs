0fUML_Library --> either primitive type (unlimitedNatural, if so null is fine), otherwise integer and if so GPT is correct'
unlimitedNatural --> number. Int is the most logical way of looking at an "unlimitedNatural". XMI says unlimitedNatural --x

0mappedby_test --> if there is something to many relation, define as list ---x, ambigious

0modelio --> PrimitiveType dateTime is used, but not defined by GPT---x  dateTime is not defined by default in Java

0modelio_lowercased_string_type --> PrimitiveType ---x

0modelio_no_validation_name_test --> PrimitiveType ---x

0modelio_wrong_typename --> PrimitiveType ---x

0user_entity_test --> if there is something to many relation, define as list ---x

1modelio --> PrimitiveType --x


1modelio_lowercased_string_type --> PrimitiveType -- PrimitiveType was not used
1modelio_wrong_typename --> PrimitiveType


FilRougeUML --> public/private, isReadOnly=true, indicates private, but visibility is public --x do we care? get/set, final
extends class is wrong ---x (generalization) 


java_sdkexample --> all the classes are already defined
