# Model Transformation With LLMs
*Model-driven engineering envisions an enhancement of software engineering by promoting automation through model transformations. However, the effective use of MDE tools often requires significant expertise due to their reliance on custom domain-specific languages for transformations. 
his expertise gap, combined with challenges like inadequate tool support and the need for additional training, has meant that model-driven engineering sometimes struggles to reduce, and can even increase, accidental complexity.
This work investigates the use of large language models, specifically ChatGPT-4, to reduce accidental complexity in model transformation processes within model-driven engineering. We conducted a systematic literature review and designed an experiment to explore ChatGPT-4â€™s efficacy in performing model transformations out-of-the-box. Using a semi-automated pipeline, we applied ChatGPT-4 to 99 UML class diagram models, generating Java programs and comparing them with ground truth programs created by a state-of-the-art modelling tool. Our findings indicate a cumulative success rate of 94% after three iterations, with most generation errors being resolved during the process. However, complex models presented a significant challenge, with a cumulative success rate of only 17%.* 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of pipeline running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The following programs are required to execute the pipeline:

* [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/sv-se/software-download)
* [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), version 2.0 and 1.1
* [Beyond Compare](https://www.scootersoftware.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java), version 1.28.1 
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [ChatGPT 4.0](https://chatgpt.com/)
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

### Installing

Once the prerequisites are all downloaded the following steps have to be conducted:

Configure language support:
```
When installing the language support make sure to configure "Format On Save," for Java. In Visual Studio code this can be done by going: 
Settings --> Command Palette --> Preferences: Configure Language Specific Settings --> Java --> Text Editor --> Formatting.
```

Specifying paths:

```
Your executable path for VS Code has to be specified in the following files:
formatJava.ahk - Lines: 4 and 11
formatJava_SecondIteration.ahk - Line 3

```


```
Your executable path for Python has to be specified in the following files:
firstIteration.bat - Lines: 51, 55, 63
secondIteration.bat - Lines: 47, 55
thirdIteration.bat - Lines: 47, 55
specificExecution.bat - Lines: 15, 23, 27, 36, 38

```

```
A shortcut to Beyond Compare has to be placed in the root directory. 

```

### Execution
For a correct execution to transpire some conditions have to be met. While rare, it is possible for ChatGPT to missunderstand the given instruction in the prompts:

```The following is an XMI file based on a UML diagram. Please write corresponding Java code without adding any explanatory text before or after. Also, do not Implement get/set functions and do not add comments in the code. Generate the classes as if they were in separate files. Furthermore, start and end the response with the tag [[STARTEND]] as a java comment.``` 

If this happens, while still executing, the output within Beyond Compare might not be correctly formatted. While it is possible to look at the raw output files, in cases where this happens, it is recommended to re-execute if a report is desired. 

Depending on the hardware used, as well as the files being executed, the timer for AutoHotKey to save the response from ChatGPT can be changed to either be longer or shorter.
To do this, go into ```runGPT.ahk``` and ```runGPTSecondIteration.ahk``` and modify the loops seen on line 22 and 24 respectively. The default value is 700 which is equivalent to 70 seconds. 

When first executing the pipeline, it is recommended to either have no browser open, or to manually open ChatGPT and have the text bar in focus. 
Furthermore, while the pipeline is executing, keep your mouse in focus on the ChatGPT window and do not click anything while it is executing. Following these steps will avoid issues related to AutoHotKey inputting the prompt in any location it shouldn't.


### Demo

If everything was installed correctly a demo can be attempted by executing the file ```specificExecution.bat``` and specifying the name ```demo```. 
After a successful execution the results are saved within the subfolder ```./allXMI/works/demo```.
Within this folder, the oracle is saved within ```/oracle```, ChatGPT's output as well as the XMI sent to it is within ```/gpt```, and the comparison can be found within ```/comparison```.
For additional iterations, a file by the name of ```comparisonReportfirstExecution.txt``` has to be created and be placed within the ```/comparison``` folder. 
This file will indicate the errors that you want ChatGPT to correct. 
Furthermore, a subfolder within ```comparison``` by the name of "secondIteration" has to be created, this is where the new result will be saved.

To execute an additional iteration, move the entire project (in this case ```demo```) to ```./allXMI/works/secondIteration``` and execute the file ```secondIteration.bat```. 
For a third iteration, move the entire project to ```./allXMI/works/secondIteration/thirdIteration```, and within the subfolder ```/secondIteration``` (for the project) create a file by the name of ```comparisonReportsecondExecution.txt```.
Furthermore, create a subfolder within ```secondIteration``` with the name ```thirdIteration```, this is where the new comparison will be saved.
Lastly, execute the file ```thirdIteration.bat```

Examples of the file structure can be found within ```./allXMI/works/secondIteration``` and ```./allXMI/works/secondIteration/thirdIteration``` respectively.

Previously executed files have their names saved within  ```previousExecutions.txt```, ```previousExecutions_SecondIteration.txt``` and ```previousExecutions_ThirdIteration.txt``` respectively.
